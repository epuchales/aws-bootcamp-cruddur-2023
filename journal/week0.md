# Concepts

## ORM
***Object-Relational Mapping***
- technique that lets query and manipulate data from a DB using an 
object-oriented paradigm

## monolithic architecture vs Microservice architecture
**Monolithic**
- all-in-one application
- the entire app is stacked in one place
- single unit
- web app, DB, 

**Microservice**
- decouples the components, making them reusable and interoperable
- helps you scale

**application Layers**
- user interface
- business logic
- data access

## iron triangle
usually you can only prioritize two things (mainly)

- scope
    - features, functionality
- time
    - schedule
- cost
    - budget, resources
